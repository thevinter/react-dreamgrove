# 1. News
## Season 4 News

### Tier Set

#### <Spell id={"394412"} name={"2-piece"}/>:

><Spell id={'78674'} name={'Starsurge'} /> and <Spell id={'191034'} name={'Starfall'} /> increase the damage of your next <Spell id={'190984'} name={'Wrath'} /> or <Spell id={'194153'} name={'Starfire'}/> by 50%, stacking up to 3 times

This is roughly a 6.2% DPS increase from having no tier.

You can treat this buff either as a passive or try stacking it to 3 before using a generator, as per usual pooling for movement and getting starlord up has higher prio.

#### <Spell id={"394414"} name={"4-piece"}/>:

>When you enter <Spell id={"79577"} name={"Eclipse"}/>, your next <Spell id={"78674"} name={"Starsurge"}/> or <Spell id={"191034"} name={"Starfall"}/> cost 30 less Astral Power and deals 60% increased damage.

This is roughly a 7.8% DPS increase from having no tier.

The buff gives you a reduced cost on your next spender every time you enter <Spell id={"79577"} name={"Eclipse"}/>. Buff is also applied when activating <Spell id={"393960"} name={"Pulsar"}/> or pressing <Spell id={"194223"} name={"CA"}/>/<Spell id={"102560"} name={"Incarnation"}/>

Total DPS from set: ~14.5%

### Antique Bronze Bullion

Season 4 brings back the Dinar system from Season 4 in Shadowlands, now under the name Antique Bronze Bullion. You will acquire this currency gradually from playing the game and it will allow you to buy "special" items from any of the 3 Dragonflight raids.

Before making any decisions on what you should spend this currency on, you should always sim your character using Droptimizer or Top Gear functions on [Raidbots](https://raidbots.com)

Here are items you should potentially spend the Antique Bronze Bullion on

## Precasting

- Cast <Spell id={"190984"} name={"Wrath"}/> twice.
- Cast <Spell id={"202347"} name={"Stellar Flare"}/>.

You can precast from max range 4 seconds before a boss is pulled.

### **What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think of these as steps to be followed in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first ability on the list that you are able to cast, provided the conditions for its use are met.


## Single Target Priority

<Checkbox id="Warrior of Elune" spellId={202425} name="Warrior of Elune" defaultCheck />
<Checkbox id="Force of Nature" spellId={205636} name="Force of Nature" />

<Checkbox id="Convoke the Spirits" spellId={391528} name="Convoke the Spirits" />

## Eclipses and Fillers


- On 1-2 targets, enter Solar Eclipse and cast <Spell id={"190984"} name={"Wrath"}/>.
- On 3 or more targets, enter Lunar Eclipse and cast <Spell id={"194153"} name={"Starfire"}/>.
- On 1-3 targets inside <Spell id={"194223"} name={"CA"}/>/<Spell id={"102560"} name={"Inc"}/> cast <Spell id={"190984"} name={"Wrath"}/>
- On 4 or more targets inside <Spell id={"194223"} name={"CA"}/>/<Spell id={"102560"} name={"Inc"}/> cast <Spell id={"194153"} name={"Starfire"}/>.


## How to Use Warrior of Elune

 
<Spell id={"202425"} name={"Warrior of Elune"}/> is an off-gcd ability, making your next 3 <Spell id={"194153"} name={"Starfires"}/> instant for 25 seconds. The ability has a 45s cooldown that starts once you've pressed it.

<Spell id={"202425"} name={"Warrior of Elune"}/> can be used 7 seconds before an eclipse ends, this way you will have just enough time to spend your third charge before the buff runs out and the CD will start earlier, which can net you more uses throughout the fight.

Use the charges to enter Solar Eclipse or as a movement GCD in <Spell id={"194223"} name={"CA"}/> /<Spell id={"102560"} name={"Inc"}/> /<Spell id={"48518"} name={"Lunar Eclipse"}/>. Using a Warrior of Elune Starfire in single target during <Spell id={"194223"} name={"CA"}/> /<Spell id={"102560"} name={"Inc"}/> is NOT a damage increase if you do not need to move.

If Warrior of Elune is falling off during <Spell id={"194223"} name={"CA"}/> /<Spell id={"102560"} name={"Inc"}/> and you still have a charge to spend, you can <Spell id={"194153"} name={"Starfire"}/> at 2+ targets.

Warrior of Elune can also be used during <Spell id={"194223"} name={"CA"}/> /<Spell id={"102560"} name={"Inc"}/> /<Spell id={"48518"} name={"Lunar Eclipse"}/> when there are adds up, this will net you a lot of Astral Power which can be useful to target down a specific add or to provide more boss damage by utilizing the AP on Starsurges.


## How to use Owlkin Frenzy procs


Use <Spell id={"157228"} name={"Owlkin Frenzy"}/> procs to enter Solar Eclipse, inside Lunar Eclipse or inside <Spell id={"194223"} name={"CA"}/>/<Spell id={"102560"} name={"Inc"}/> if Starfire will hit 3 or more targets.

Keep in mind that <Spell id={"202425"} name={"Warrior of Elune"}/> charges are consumed before <Spell id={"157228"} name={"Owlkin Frenzy"}/> procs.

# 3. Talents

	
## Raid

<Talents name={"Single Target"} talents={"BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJJigkQQSikIFolIJSSJRTcgQol0SSERDgCAE"}/>

<Talents name={"Single Target with Short Burst"} talents={"BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJJigkQQSikIFolIJSSJRTcgQkWSLJRQDgCAE"}/>

## Mythic+

The following are dungeon talent builds that will always serve you well but mind that there can be some variations based on your group comp or affixes. <Spell id={"274281"} name={"New Moon"}/> and <Spell id={"211545"} name={"Fury of Elune"}/> can be used interchangeably.

<Talents name={"Balanced build"} talents={"BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJJigkQQSikcgUgWiDkkkUSCJJgm0iEJ0AoAAB"}/>

<Talents name={"Weaver build"} talents={"BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJJigkQQSikcgUgWiDkkkUSCJJgm0iEJUAoAAB"}/>


<Spell id={"274281"} name={"New Moon"}/> provides more single target damage and is easy to pair with pulsar.
<Spell id={"211545"} name={"FoE"}/> does slightly more AoE but is more difficult to align with <Spell id={"393961"} name={"Pulsar"}/>, making it annoying to play.

The below picture showcases which talents are "mandatory" and which talents you can opt-in to:

**Secondary builds:**

[Class tree with Hibernate for Incorporeal](https://raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJJJCSCBJJSiUgWiDkkkUSCJHIEaSJCJRDgCAE?bgcolor=000000)

[If you really need both Hibernate and Remove Corruption](https://raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCQkkkISSAkESiUgWiDkkkUSCJHIEaSJCJRDgCAE?bgcolor=000000)

- <Spell id={"377842"} name={"Ursine Vigor"}/>, <Spell id={"377847"} name={"Well-Honed Instincts"}/> and <Spell id={"288826"} name={"Improved Stampeding Roar"}/> are the major competing talents. <Spell id={"377842"} name={"Ursine Vigor"}/> should be taken if you need it to survive certain abilities. <Spell id={"377847"} name={"Well-Honed Instincts"}/> is always on 1 point but a 2nd can be taken if you rarely/never use Bear Form. spell 288826 "Improved Stampeding Roar">}} is extremely useful in indoor dungeons and in spiteful weeks.
- <Spell id={"2782"} name={"Remove Corruption"}/> should be taken in Afflicted weeks.
- <Spell id={"33786"} name={"Cyclone"}/> has basically no use other than stopping Bursting and can be replaced with anything else(which also won't have any use).
- <Spell id={"2637"} name={"Hibernate"}/> can be used for the Incorporeal affix.
- For lower keys, you can put 1 point into <Spell id={"131768"} name={"Feline Swiftness"}/> like [this](https://raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJiIIJSQSikIFHgWiDEJJlkQSChmUiEJRDgCAE?bgcolor=000000). This skips <Spell id={"377842"} name={"Ursine Vigor"}/> and <Spell id={"132469"} name={"Typhoon"}/>. You can also drop any of the other bottom talents you don't need to get a 2nd point in <Spell id={"131768"} name={"Feline Swiftness"}/> to get around even quicker for farming keys.
- All other talents in the druid tree are more or less set.


# 4. Consumables
## Potions

https://www.wowhead.com/item=191383/elemental-potion-of-ultimate-power

Use this for every situation. Potion of Elemental Power is only minorly worse if you want to save gold.

## [Food](#food)


https://www.wowhead.com/item=197794/grand-banquet-of-the-kaluak: Intellect buff

https://www.wowhead.com/item=204072/deviously-deviled-eggs: Same buff as Banquet but with a cheaper individual price.

https://www.wowhead.com/item=197784/sizzling-seafood-medley: Provides Haste + Mastery which can be more dps than the Intellect food.

https://www.wowhead.com/item=197786/thousandbone-tongueslicer: Provides Crit + Mastery which can be more dps than the Intellect food.

The secondary food can be better as you acquire more gear, they provide more total stats than the main stat one. Sim your character to see what is best for you.

## Phials

**ST & AoE**

Damage wise, with 100% uptime on all of the Phials and not counting in the downsides their hierarchy is as follows on ST:

- https://www.wowhead.com/item=191329/iced-phial-of-corrupting-rage: Default phial unless the fight has too high damage intake or you are at risk of dying. Do not use this in progress fights unless you really need the damage.
- https://www.wowhead.com/item=191341/phial-of-tepid-versatility: Has the same value as Corrupting Rage at 60% uptime. Can be worth to play if the damage intake is high.
- https://www.wowhead.com/item=191359/phial-of-elemental-chaos: : Generally similar dps throughput as Tepid Versatility, but less defensive benefits.


## Runes


Our main rune is https://www.wowhead.com/item=204973/hissing-rune: Mastery rune>

In some cases either https://www.wowhead.com/item=194820/howling-rune or https://www.wowhead.com/item=194823/buzzing-rune might sim slightly better.

# 5. Gearing
## Stat Priority


Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). **Do not follow any stat priorities.**
## Enchants

Sim between these two options to determine which one is best for your character.

- Chest - [Waking Stats](https://www.wowhead.com/item=200030/enchant-chest-waking-stats?crafting-quality=6) Intellect

- Legs - [Lambent Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=204702/lambent-armor-kit?crafting-quality=6)/[Frozen Spellthread](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194013/frozen-spellthread?crafting-quality=6)
- Sim between these two options to determine which one is best for your character.

- Boots - [Watchers Loam](https://www.wowhead.com/item=200020/enchant-boots-watchers-loam) Stamina
- Ring - [Devotion of Mastery](https://www.wowhead.com/item=200039/enchant-ring-devotion-of-mastery?crafting-quality=6) You should always sim your own character to determine what enchant to use in this slot.
